    <%= @name %>


app/shadows/product_shadow.rb

    class Product::Shadow < Shadows::Base

      def form
        @product.new_record?? render_shape(:new) : render_shape(:edit)
      end

    end


app/controllers/products_controller.rb

    class ProductsController < ApplicationController

      def show
        product = Product.find params[:id]
        render :text => product.to_s, :layout => true
      end
      def new
        product = Product.new
        # :render not yet implemented
        product.render :form
      end

      # ...

    end
